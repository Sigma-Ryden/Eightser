# SF (SerializationFixture) - Simple serialization library

`SF` is a flexible and extensible C++ library with many features, that will allow you to easily
and quickly turn your objects into a sequence of bits.
The library has a small code base, but enough to use it.

Use macros for code generation or read the documentation and write your own code.
There are 2 main serialization classes under your control: `OArchive` and `IArchive`.
Both classes can be equipped with additional helper classes via template parameters if needed.
A wrapper for streams will help you flexibly configure the process of writing and reading data.
The type registrar will allow you to properly serialize and deserialize polymorphic and abstract types.

Is a header-only library implemented purely in C++11.

See last stable library version [here](https://github.com/Sigma-Ryden/SerializationFixture/tree/master/package).

## Functional:

### Serialization of common types:
- All arithmetic types
- Enum or scoped enum
- Static or dynamic array
- Bit fields

### Data tracking:
- Raw pointers
- Smart pointers: unique, shared, weak
- Aliasing as referencing

### Serialization of standard library types:
- C++11: string, vector, map, and many others
- C++17: any, optional, variant

See full list [here](https://github.com/Sigma-Ryden/SerializationFixture/tree/master/include/SF/BuiltIn).
### Serialization of user classes:
- Aggregate (since C++17)
- Common/Union/Template
- Hierarchy
- Polymorphic/Abstract
- Virtual Inheritance

## Auto Tests:
See library testing [here](https://github.com/Sigma-Ryden/SerializationFixture/tree/master/test).

## Quick start:
Warning! This is a simple example. You can see more examples [here](https://github.com/Sigma-Ryden/SerializationFixture/tree/master/test/demo).

Preparing:

```C++
#include <SF/Core.hpp>
```
Let's include serialization support of common STL types:
```C++
#include <SF/BuiltIn/string.hpp>
#include <SF/BuiltIn/vector.hpp>
#include <SF/BuiltIn/map.hpp>
#include <SF/BuiltIn/shared_ptr.hpp>
```
And let's write own serializable types:
```C++
enum class Property
{
    Speed,
    Force,
    inteligance,
    Fly
};

struct Prototype
{
    std::string name;
    std::vector<Property> properties;
};

struct Handbook
{
    std::map<int, std::shared_ptr<Prototype>> prototypes;
};
```
Lets write serialization functions (since C++17 we can ommit it, for aggregate types).
```C++
SERIALIZATION(SaveLoad, Prototype)
{
    archive & self.name & self.properties;
}

SERIALIZATION(SaveLoad, Handbook)
{
    archive & self.prototypes;
}
```
Explaining of using macros above:
- ```SERIALIZATION(<mode>, <type>)``` - Generate Save/Load/SaveLoad serialization functions for given class.

### Using of serialization library:

Sinse we are going to use memory storage, let's define a variable for it:
```C++
std::vector<unsigned char> storage;
```
Let's prepare our data for save:
```C++
Handbook db;

auto zero = std::make_shared<Prototype>();
zero->name = "Zero";
zero->properties = {Property::Speed};

auto rew = std::make_shared<Prototype>();
rew->name = "Rew";
rew->properties = {Property::Force};

auto ifly = std::make_shared<Prototype>();
ifly->name = "I.Fly";
ifly->properties = {Property::inteligance, Property::Fly};

db.prototypes[0] = zero;
db.prototypes[3] = rew;
db.prototypes[2] = ifly;
```

Serialization prepared data:
```C++
auto ar = sf::oarchive(storage);
ar & db;
```

Deserialization from storage:
```C++
Handbook db; // some other clear db

auto ar = sf::iarchive(storage);
ar & db;
```
See full code here: [TestExample.cpp](https://github.com/Sigma-Ryden/SerializationFixture/tree/master/test/demo/TestExample.cpp)

### Notes:
For ```OArchive``` objects, you may also using overloaded ```operator <<``` instead ```operator &```
or ```operator()```, and also ```operator >>``` for ```IArchive``` objects.

Examples:
```C++
// saving objects to the archive
archive << obj_0 << ... << obj_n;
// loading objects from the archive
archive >> obj_0 >> ... >> obj_n;

//depends on archive type
archive & obj_0 & ... & obj_n;
// or
archive(obj_0, ..., obj_n);
```
